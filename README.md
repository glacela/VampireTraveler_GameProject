# Vampire Traveler

Very unfinished soloproject for Gamerella Global 2021 game jam. The theme was "Journey".

The jam was less than a week after Pride Game Jam 2021 so I didn't have a lot of juice left.

I did the graphics and programming in this project.

### Idea / Story

I'm gonna explain what plans I had even when I didn't get to do much, maybe one day I'll get back to this.

My goal was to revisit Unity and C#. 2D platformer seemed like the most simple idea.

The game's story is about a vampire somewhere in the future visiting her memories/"time traveling" to unlock hints to work something out in the present.

I'm not super knowledgable about fighting mechanics, so I thought instead of fighting you'd have to do sneaky things like bite people when their backs are turned so you can get some vampire energy to turn into a bat and fly etc.
